  description: 'JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing
    claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded
    as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure
    or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims
    to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code
    (MAC) and/or encrypted. '
