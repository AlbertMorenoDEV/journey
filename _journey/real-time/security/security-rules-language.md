  description: Firebase provides a flexible, expression-based rules language with
    JavaScript-like syntax to easily define how your data should be structured and
    when your data can be read from and written to. Combined with our login service
    which allows for easy authentication, you can define who has access to what data
    and keep all of your user's personal information secure. The Security and Firebase
    Rules live on the Firebase servers and are automatically enforced at all times.
