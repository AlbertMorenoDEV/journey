  description: 'An access control list (ACL), with respect to a computer file system,
    is a list of permissions attached to an object. An ACL specifies which users or
    system processes are granted access to objects, as well as what operations are
    allowed on given objects.[1] Each entry in a typical ACL specifies a subject and
    an operation. For instance, if a file object has an ACL that contains (Alice:
    read, write; Bob: read), this would give Alice permission to read and write the
    file and Bob to only read it.'
