  description: A beacon is an intentionally conspicuous device designed to attract
    attention to a specific location. Beacons can also be combined with semaphoric
    or other indicators to provide important information, such as the status of an
    airport, by the color and rotational pattern of its airport beacon, or of pending
    weather as indicated on a weather beacon mounted at the top of a tall building
    or similar site. When used in such fashion, beacons can be considered a form of
    optical telegraphy.
