  description: MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/Internet of Things connectivity
    protocol. It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging
    transport. It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code
    footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.
