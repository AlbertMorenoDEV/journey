  description: The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a core protocol of the Internet
    protocol suite. It originated in the initial network implementation in which it
    complemented the Internet Protocol (IP). Therefore, the entire suite is commonly
    referred to as TCP/IP. TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery
    of a stream of octets between applications running on hosts communicating over
    an IP network.
