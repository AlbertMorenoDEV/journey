  description: The Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is a network control protocol
    designed for use in entertainment and communications systems to control streaming
    media servers. The protocol is used for establishing and controlling media sessions
    between end points. Clients of media servers issue VCR-style commands, such as
    play and pause, to facilitate real-time control of playback of media files from
    the server.
