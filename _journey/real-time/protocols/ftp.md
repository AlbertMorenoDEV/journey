  description: The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used
    to transfer computer files between a client and server on a computer network.
    FTP is built on a client-server model architecture and uses separate control and
    data connections between the client and the server.[1] FTP users may authenticate
    themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username
    and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow
    it.
