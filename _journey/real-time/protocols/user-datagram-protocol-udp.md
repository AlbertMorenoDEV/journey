  description: The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core members of the
    Internet protocol suite. The protocol was designed by David P. Reed in 1980 and
    formally defined in RFC 768. UDP uses a simple connectionless transmission model
    with a minimum of protocol mechanism. It has no handshaking dialogues, and thus
    exposes the user's program to any unreliability of the underlying network protocol.
    There is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. UDP provides
    checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions
    at the source and destination of the datagram.
