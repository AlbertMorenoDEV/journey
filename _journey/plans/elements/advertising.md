  description: API resources exist in support of advertising related elements of platform
    operations, driving advertising, or possibly alleviating the need for advertising
    to be present. The purpose of the APIs might be directly tied to advertising,
    or be more about helping drive traffic, or attention to resources that depend
    on advertising for their revenue. This element is focused on how advertising is
    coupled to API planning, no matter how tight it is.
