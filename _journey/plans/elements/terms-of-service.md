  description: API resources allow for the dynamic configuration of available terms
    of service that cover access and usage of resources. Terms of service will play
    a key role in defining every element of platforms, so it makes sense that it can
    be a variable used across API planning decisions, and even allow for it to be
    part of different levels of plans, allowing TOS to play variable roles, depending
    on which plan you exist in.
