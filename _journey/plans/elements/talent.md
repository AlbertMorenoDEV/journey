  description: API resources are focused on driving talent acquisition, or even placement
    with ecosystem related companies or as part of wider services. This could be in
    support of an actual recruitment platform, or could just be one aspect of what
    an API platform does to support talent needed internally, by partners, or even
    end-users of recruitment related services.
