  description: Is a primary focus of an API platform centered around driving traffic
    to a web or mobile presence. If there is a solid business model around users accessing
    content or data, driving traffic through an API, without charging API consumers
    can be a successful approach. How can API consumers be incentivized to drive more
    traffic to web and mobile properties, by extending the reach of the platform through
    APIs.
