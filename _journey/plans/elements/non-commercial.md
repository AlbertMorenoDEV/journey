  description: The platform allows for non-commercial access to resources, which usually
    means there is additional commercial requirements. Allowing non-profit organizations,
    researchers, and other potential API consumers the ability to validate their identity,
    and achieve reduced, or free levels of access can benefit the overall platform
    reach, and potential marketing engine.
