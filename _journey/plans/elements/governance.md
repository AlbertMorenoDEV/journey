  description: API resources are focused on governance related tasks within a company
    or possibly a wider industry. For APIs that operate in more heavily regulated
    spaces, governance will be a pretty big element of planning around APIs. Governance
    can be applied across API operations, and subject to variability depending on
    plan levels and partner tiers of access.
