  description: There are customization opportunities around API plans, pricing, and
    rate limits, giving more control to consumers to customize their experience. For
    many plans, things may be fixed, but as you go further up the chain, into enterprise
    and partner level tiers, there may be opportunities for customization of plan
    elements, where other users do not have the opportunity.
