  description: An API primarily exists to support the existence, or drive the sales
    of another product, or product line. I separate out devices from this grouping,
    because they require separate attention. This could describe entire supply chain
    integration using APIs, all the way to affiliate or reseller style systems like
    used by Amazon. There are a number of ways products can be sold, by putting APIs
    to work.
