  description: There are APIs available to access all or part of the plans, pricing,
    or limitations around an API platform operations. The API platforms I track on
    that have been around the longest, and are the most mature, have APIs for consumers
    to use, that gives access to plan information, rate limits, pricing, and other
    aspects of API operations. I include this as essential, because it will be something
    every API provider will need to complete in the future.
