  description: Is a big part of API operations about driving marketing efforts for
    other aspects of business operations. Direct API access is not always the primary
    motivation for having an API, especially a public API. There are a number of ways
    to increase attention to products, services, as well as the overall corporate
    engine using APIs. Acknowledging this across API planning is important to understanding
    the value generated by API consumption, beyond direct elements.
