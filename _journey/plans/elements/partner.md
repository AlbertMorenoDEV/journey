  description: There is a focus on partner access to resources, resulting in separate
    access layers, and features dedicated to partner level consumption. While anyone
    accessing APIs can be considered a partner, these levels of access usually require
    much more vetting, making sure business objectives are in alignment, and legal
    obligations are met. Keeping partner access layers as transparent as possible
    helps keep harmony with lower levels of public, or even internal API access.
