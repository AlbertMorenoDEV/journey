  description: Situations where APIs are available in support of devices. You can
    see examples of this with Fitbit or Nest, where they API is just value-add to
    the devices, allowing 3rd parties to develop applications, and put content or
    data to use that is generated around the API. This is the layer of the API space
    that is expanding to what is often called Internet of Things (IoT).
