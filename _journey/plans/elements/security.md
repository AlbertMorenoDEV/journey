  description: Access to API resources provide a security benefit, or are in support
    of other related security products and services. There should always be a base
    level of security to just keep a platform stable, but sometimes additional, or
    tighter security elements can be factored into the plan for overall platform operations.
    Security is an ever-increasing aspect of overall platform health and stability.
