  description: API resources allow for, or depend on donations as part of platform
    operations. Not all APIs will be operating for profit, and will require donations
    for all, or part of the operational budget. These donations might be large, or
    they might be smaller from individual API consumers, or possibly end-user groups
    that benefit from an APIs existence.
