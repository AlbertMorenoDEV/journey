  description: API resources exist because of grant related resources, which pay for
    their design, deployment or operations. Similar to donations, grants could be
    more formal funding opportunities for certain APIs that provide a civic or public
    good. Part of the goal in identifying this as a building block, is bringing more
    focus to the need of some APIs in this area, and drive more grant funding their
    way.
