  description: 'This document proposes an additional endpoint for OAuth authorization
    servers, which allows clients to notify the authorization server that a previously
    obtained refresh or access token is no longer needed. This allows the authorization
    server to clean up security credentials. A revocation request will invalidate
    the actual token and, if applicable, other tokens based on the same authorization
    grant. '
