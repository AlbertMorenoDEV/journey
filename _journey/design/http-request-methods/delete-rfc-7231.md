  description: 'The DELETE method requests that the origin server remove the association
    between the target resource and its current functionality. In effect, this method
    is similar to the rm command in UNIX: it expresses a deletion operation on the
    URI mapping of the origin server rather than an expectation that the previously
    associated information be deleted. '
