  description: 'The "signature" HTTP Header is based on the model that the sender
    must authenticate itself with a digital signature produced by either a private
    asymmetric key (e.g., RSA) or a shared symmetric key (e.g., HMAC). The scheme
    is parameterized enough such that it is not bound to any particular key type or
    signing algorithm. However, it does explicitly assume that senders can send an
    HTTP ''Date'' header. '
