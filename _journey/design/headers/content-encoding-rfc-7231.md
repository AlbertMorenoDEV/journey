  description: 'The "Content-Encoding" header field indicates what content codings
    have been applied to the representation, beyond those inherent in the media type,
    and thus what decoding mechanisms have to be applied in order to obtain data in
    the media type referenced by the Content-Type header field. Content-Encoding is
    primarily used to allow a representative''s data to be compressed without losing
    the identity of its underlying media type. '
