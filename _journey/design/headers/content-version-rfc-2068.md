  description: 'The Content-Version entity-header field defines the version tag associated
    with a rendition of an evolving entity. Together with the Derived-From field,
    it allows a group of people to work simultaneously on the creation of a work as
    an iterative process. The field should be used to allow evolution of a particular
    work along a single path rather than derived works or renditions in different
    representations. '
