  description: 'In HTTP, the "Accept" request-header field is used to specify media
    types which are acceptable for the response. However, in HTCPCP, the response
    may result in additional actions on the part of the automated pot. For this reason,
    HTCPCP adds a new header field, "Accept-Additions".It has been observed that some
    users of blended teas have an occasional preference for teas brewed as an emulsion
    of cane sugar with hints of water. To allow for this circumstance, the Accept-Additions
    header field defined in the base HTCPCP specification is updated to allow the
    following options. '
