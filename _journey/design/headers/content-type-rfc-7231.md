  description: 'The "Content-Type" header field indicates the media type of the associated
    representation: either the representation enclosed in the message payload or the
    selected representation, as determined by the message semantics. The indicated
    media type defines both the data format and how that data is intended to be processed
    by a recipient, within the scope of the received message semantics, after any
    content codings indicated by Content-Encoding are decoded. '
