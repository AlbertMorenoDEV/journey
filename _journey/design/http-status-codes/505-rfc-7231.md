  description: 'The 505 (HTTP Version Not Supported) status code indicates that the
    server does not support, or refuses to support, the major version of HTTP that
    was used in the request message. The server is indicating that it is unable or
    unwilling to complete the request using the same major version as the client,
    other than with this error message. The server SHOULD generate a representation
    for the 505 response that describes why that version is not supported and what
    other protocols are supported by that server. '
