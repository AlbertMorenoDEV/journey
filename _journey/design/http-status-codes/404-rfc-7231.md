  description: 'The 404 (Not Found) status code indicates that the origin server did
    not find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing to
    disclose that one exists. A 404 status code does not indicate whether this lack
    of representation is temporary or permanent; the 410 (Gone) status code is preferred
    over 404 if the origin server knows, presumably through some configurable means,
    that the condition is likely to be permanent. '
