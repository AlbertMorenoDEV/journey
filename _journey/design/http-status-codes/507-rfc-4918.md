  description: 'The 507 (Insufficient Storage) status code means the method could
    not be performed on the resource because the server is unable to store the representation
    needed to successfully complete the request. This condition is considered to be
    temporary. If the request that received this status code was the result of a user
    action, the request MUST NOT be repeated until it is requested by a separate user
    action. '
