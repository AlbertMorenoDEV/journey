  description: 'The 408 (Request Timeout) status code indicates that the server did
    not receive a complete request message within the time that it was prepared to
    wait. A server SHOULD send the "close" connection option in the response, since
    408 implies that the server has decided to close the connection rather than continue
    waiting. If the client has an outstanding request in transit, the client MAY repeat
    that request on a new connection. '
