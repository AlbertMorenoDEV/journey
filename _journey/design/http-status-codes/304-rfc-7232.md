  description: 'The 304 (Not Modified) status code indicates that a conditional GET
    or HEAD request has been received and would have resulted in a 200 (OK) response
    if it were not for the fact that the condition evaluated to false. In other words,
    there is no need for the server to transfer a representation of the target resource
    because the request indicates that the client, which made the request conditional,
    already has a valid representation; the server is therefore redirecting the client
    to make use of that stored representation as if it were the payload of a 200 (OK)
    response. '
