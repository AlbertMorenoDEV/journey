  description: 'The 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) status code is similar to
    401 (Unauthorized), but it indicates that the client needs to authenticate itself
    in order to use a proxy. The proxy MUST send a Proxy-Authenticate header field
    containing a challenge applicable to that proxy for the target resource. The client
    MAY repeat the request with a new or replaced Proxy-Authorization header field. '
