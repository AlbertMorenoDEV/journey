  description: 'The 202 (Accepted) status code indicates that the request has been
    accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request
    might or might not eventually be acted upon, as it might be disallowed when processing
    actually takes place. There is no facility in HTTP for re-sending a status code
    from an asynchronous operation. '
