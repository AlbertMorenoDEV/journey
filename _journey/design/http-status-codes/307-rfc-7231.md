  description: 'The 307 (Temporary Redirect) status code indicates that the target
    resource resides temporarily under a different URI and the user agent MUST NOT
    change the request method if it performs an automatic redirection to that URI.
    Since the redirection can change over time, the client ought to continue using
    the original effective request URI for future requests. '
