  description: 'The 424 (Failed Dependency) status code means that the method could
    not be performed on the resource because the requested action depended on another
    action and that action failed. For example, if a command in a PROPPATCH method
    fails, then, at minimum, the rest of the commands will also fail with 424 (Failed
    Dependency). '
