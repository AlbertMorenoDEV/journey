  description: 'The 102 (Processing) status code is an interim response used to inform
    the client that the server has accepted the complete request, but has not yet
    completed it. This status code SHOULD only be sent when the server has a reasonable
    expectation that the request will take significant time to complete. As guidance,
    if a method is taking longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable, but arbitrary value)
    to process the server SHOULD return a 102 (Processing) response. The server MUST
    send a final response after the request has been completed. '
