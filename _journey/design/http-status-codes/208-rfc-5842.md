  description: 'The 208 (Already Reported) status code can be used inside a DAV: propstat
    response element to avoid enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings
    to the same collection repeatedly. For each binding to a collection inside the
    request''s scope, only one will be reported with a 200 status, while subsequent
    DAV:response elements for all other bindings will use the 208 status, and no DAV:response
    elements for their descendants are included. '
