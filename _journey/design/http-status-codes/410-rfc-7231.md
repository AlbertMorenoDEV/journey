  description: 'The 410 (Gone) status code indicates that access to the target resource
    is no longer available at the origin server and that this condition is likely
    to be permanent. If the origin server does not know, or has no facility to determine,
    whether or not the condition is permanent, the status code 404 (Not Found) ought
    to be used instead. '
