  description: 'The 412 (Precondition Failed) status code indicates that one or more
    conditions given in the request header fields evaluated to false when tested on
    the server. This response code allows the client to place preconditions on the
    current resource state (its current representations and metadata) and, thus, prevent
    the request method from being applied if the target resource is in an unexpected
    state. '
