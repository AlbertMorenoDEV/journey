  description: 'The 303 (See Other) status code indicates that the server is redirecting
    the user agent to a different resource, as indicated by a URI in the Location
    header field, which is intended to provide an indirect response to the original
    request. A user agent can perform a retrieval request targeting that URI (a GET
    or HEAD request if using HTTP), which might also be redirected, and present the
    eventual result as an answer to the original request. Note that the new URI in
    the Location header field is not considered equivalent to the effective request
    URI. '
